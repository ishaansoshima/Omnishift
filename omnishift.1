OMNISHIFT(1)                 General Commands Manual                OMNISHIFT(1)

NAME
       omnishift - Convert image files to a specified format from the command line.

SYNOPSIS
       omnishift INPUT_PATH OUTPUT_FORMAT

DESCRIPTION
       Omnishift is a command-line tool for converting images between various formats.
       The tool supports popular image formats, including JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF.
       It is powered by Python's Pillow library and is suitable for quick format conversions.

OPTIONS
       INPUT_PATH
              The path to the input image file that you want to convert.
              This should be a valid path to an image file, such as "image.jpg" or "pictures/sample.png".

       OUTPUT_FORMAT
              The target format for the converted image. Supported formats include:
              "png", "jpg", "jpeg", "bmp", "gif", and "tiff".
              Note that the output format should be provided without the leading dot (e.g., "png" instead of ".png").

EXAMPLES
       Convert a PNG file to JPEG format:
              omnishift input_image.png jpg

       Convert a TIFF file to GIF format:
              omnishift sample_image.tiff gif

       Convert a BMP file to PNG format:
              omnishift picture.bmp png

SUPPORTED FORMATS
       Omnishift supports the following output formats:
       - JPEG (jpg or jpeg)
       - PNG
       - BMP
       - GIF
       - TIFF

NOTES
       - When converting to JPEG format, omnishift will automatically convert the image to RGB mode if needed,
         as JPEG does not support transparency or other modes.
       - If the specified output format is not in the supported list, omnishift will return an error.

ERRORS
       If an error occurs, such as if the input file does not exist or the format is unsupported, omnishift will print
       an error message to the terminal and stop processing.
